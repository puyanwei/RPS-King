# Rock Paper Scissors King

Can you beat the RPS King? Watch out, because he's been a professional poker player for 20 years, and that experience is going to give him a huge edge!

The aim of this project is to continue to get a better understanding of Vue.js, as well as work out how to the testing framework works. I aim to produce this project with the intention of testing first before writing my code.

### Installation

```
git@github.com:puyanwei/RPS-King.git
cd RPS-king
npm install
npm run dev
```

This should open a browser window and go to localhost:8080

### Tech Stack

* Vue.js
* HTML
* CSS

### Process

To better understand how testing would work in Vue.js, I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2QKTNmU-Tc) by 'Program with Erik' to help me set it up which included testing coverage.
